      <h2>Creation & Development</h2>
      <p>
        In 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee was casting for a new superhero idea.
        He said the idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify.
        As with Fantastic Four, Lee saw Spider-Man as an opportunity to "get out of his system" what he felt was missing in comic books. In his autobiography, 
        Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter the Spider as a great influence, and in a multitude of print and video interviews, 
        Lee stated he was further inspired by seeing a spider climb up a wall — adding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become 
        unsure of whether or not this is true.
